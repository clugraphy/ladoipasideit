  # Contact Me (But Don't Actually)

Look, I'll be honest with you - this contact form is mostly here because it looks professional.
I probably won't check it as often as I should. ðŸ˜…

## The Truth About Contact Forms

- They're like digital message bottles - you never know if they'll reach their destination
- They often end up in spam folders (mine included)
- They're about as effective as shouting into the void (but less cathartic)

## Better Ways to Reach Me

- **LinkedIn**: [Let's connect professionally](https://linkedin.com/in/alexandru.catalin.stroe) - I actually check this!
- **Instagram**: [@yourhandle](https://instagram.com/clugraphy) - For the more casual stuff
- **Email**: [alexandru.catalin.stroe@gmail.com](mailto:alexandru.catalin.stroe@gmail.com) - If you must (but really, just use LinkedIn)

## Still Want to Try?

Fine, be my guest! Fill out the form below.
But remember, you've been warned! ðŸš¨

  P.S. If you're reading this and thinking "wow, this is unprofessional" -
  you're probably right! But at least I'm honest about it. ðŸ˜‰
